README

"Paper scissors rock" game:

Clone the entire git repository. Make sure all the files are two directories away from the ence260 folder.

After you make/compile, select a move to play using the navswitch NORTH and SOUTH. The LED matrix will cycle through 'P' for 'Paper', 'R' for 'Rock' and 'S' for 'Scissors'.

When you have finalised your decision, PUSH the navswitch to select it, when your opponent has done the same, you will both get a message on the LED matrix with the outcome of the game.

Ensure there is minimal light sources on the IR receivers before beginning, as any kind of interference will effect the game.
